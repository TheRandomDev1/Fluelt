# Introduction with `console.log()` method.

We're starting things off by doing the same things that almost every single tutorial does. Starting with a simple console log message.

The console is a panel that displays important messages such as errors, values, and more. Much of the computer's work with our code is invisible to us by default. If we want to see things on ourselves, we can print or log in directly to our console.

In JavaScript, a console keyword refers to an object, a collection of information and functions that we can use in our code. Keywords are built-in words in JavaScript, so your computer recognizes them and processes them specifically.

One method built into a console object is the `.log()` method.
> We will cover methods in future lessons.
When we type `console.log()`, what we put in parentheses is printed in the console.

Printing values to the console is very useful for us so we can see the work we are doing.
```js
Console.log("Hello, World!");
```
Output: 
```
Hello, world!
```
